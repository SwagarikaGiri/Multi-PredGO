Welcome to Multi-PredGO Application:
Multi-PredGO is a multi-modal protein function prediction model that uses the protein sequence, protein structure, and protein-protein interaction network-based information to predict GO-based protein function. As the protein function classes are dependent on each other, we have used a neuro-symbolic hierarchical classification model, which resembles the structure of Gene Ontology (GO), for effectively predicting the dependent protein functions.
